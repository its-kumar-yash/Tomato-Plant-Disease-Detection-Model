# Tomato Plant Disease Detection using TinyML

## Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for identifying tomato plant diseases from leaf images. Leveraging TensorFlow Lite and Edge Impulse, we create a compact model suitable for deployment on edge devices. The model enables real-time disease diagnosis, aiding agricultural decision-making.

### Dataset Used - [Plant Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

## Key Features
- `Dataset`: Plant Village dataset containing `16,011` tomato leaf images across `10` disease categories.
- `Methodology`: Data preprocessing, model development, conversion, deployment, evaluation, and validation.
- `Results`: Achieved accuracy of `89.6%` in disease identification.
- `Expected Outcomes`: High-performing, lightweight ML model, successful deployment on edge devices, real-world effectiveness.
- `Real-World Use`: Real-time plant health prediction via the Edge Impulse app on mobile devices.
